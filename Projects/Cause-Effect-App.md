# CauseEffect

Patterns are integral to software engineering and represent potentially
reusable components in program logic. However, patterns aren't used only
for program logic, they are exist in other domains such as DevOps, user
support, and the user interface.

A common user interface pattern is to summarize data in one section of a page 
that consists of some type of list (like text, images, or icons) that describes
or categorizes a set of data. When a list item is clicked, the detailed data
behind it is displayed in an adjacent pane on the page. 

For example, on a real estate site clicking an address in a list of properties
for sale displays the details about the property in another part of the 
page.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can see a list of person names arranged vertically in a summary
pane on the page.
-   [ ] User can click on a name in the list to update an adjacent pane on the
page with that individuals full name, address, telephone number, and 
birthday.
-   [ ] User can click on another name in the list to refresh the detail pane
with that individuals information.

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can see the person name in the summary pane highlighted when the
cursor is hovered over it.
-   [ ] User can see the person name in the summary pane highlighted
using a selection effect (color, size, etc.) when it is clicked. This is a
different effect from the hover effect
-   [ ] User can see the selection effect removed from a name in the summary
list when a new name is clicked.
